![Hi there](https://media.giphy.com/media/a1QLZUUtCcgyA/giphy.gif)

Software Engineer for Flutter/Dart and Android/Kotlin. My interests lie in coding, tech writing, 3D modelling, open source, movies and games. Currently working as a Software Engineer at Fatdoglabs.

I started my coding journey from Android/Kotlin and then got a taste for Flutter. Getting more in-tuned with flutter, I started contributing to the wonderful coding community by writing various tech articles as well as collaborating with other Flutter enthusiasts.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an app for the Jordan based company Base-Coffee
- ðŸ’¬ I love custom widget creation. Reach out and we will both learn the inner workings of the Flutter framework and learn how to create unique widgets.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Love watching movies. Finding underrated flicks has always been a passion of mine.
